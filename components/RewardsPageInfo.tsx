            <Text>
                Hive Tokens: These are tradable tokens that can be transferred at any time. You can convert Hive into Hive Power in a process called "powering up".

            <Text>
                Hive Power: This is always a reward on posts. When you exchange Hive for Hive Power (also known as "Powering Up" or "Staking"), you gain special abilities on the Hive Blockchain. These include larger voting power and increased curation rewards, more resource credits to do transactions on the Hive Blockchain, and more stake in Hive governance to support witnesses and projects.

                Hive Backed Dollars (HBD): These are tokens worth about $1.00 of Hive.

                Savings: You can transfer your Hive or HBD to savings for greater safety. The balance is subject to a 3-day withdrawal waiting period. HBD in savings increases at 20.00% APR as defined by the witnesses.

                Remember, you can manage your Hive tokens at your wallet. By clicking on your wallet, you'll notice terms like Hive, Hive Power, Hive Dollars, Savings, and Estimated Account Value. The estimated US dollars value is based on an average value of the tokens in your wallet.
